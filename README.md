# 📘 DSA Sheet by Shivam Kumar Ashish

This repository contains my curated **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Sheet**, aimed at helping students and aspiring software developers master DSA concepts and prepare for coding interviews and placements efficiently.

## 📌 About


The goal of this DSA Sheet is to provide a **structured learning path** covering the most important problems and concepts in:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
- Sliding Window, Two Pointer, etc.

Each topic is organized in folders with well-documented solutions and problem links (mostly from **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **CodeStudio**, etc.).
